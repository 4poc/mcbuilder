This is a tool for minecraft map makers, it reads placed signs from a
world that contains an ID and description, like "1# foo" it will then
use a xml file that specifies an replacement for this sign, like a
chest or a spawner.

(Planned) Features:
* replace with spawners, chests, blocks, etc.
* replace with entities like villagers etc.
* copy custom nbt data
* warnings for unspecified signs
* "point" signs to reference sign locations in command blocks, etc.
* constants to replace in strings
* usable as multipliers for numerical values
* simple include feature to seperate buildfile in multiple xml files
